# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Project Overview

The Smart Furniture Store System is a web-based platform designed to provide a modern and intelligent shopping experience for furniture products. The system allows customers to browse, explore, and purchase a wide range of furniture items through an easy-to-use and interactive interface.

This platform is designed not only as a traditional e-commerce store, but also as a smart system that enhances user experience by providing features such as product categorization, search functionality, personalized recommendations, and detailed product visualization.

The system supports three main types of users: Customers, who can browse and purchase furniture; Sellers, who can manage and upload their furniture products; and Administrators, who oversee the entire system, manage users, and monitor sales and performance.

The Smart Furniture Store aims to simplify the process of buying and selling furniture online by providing a centralized platform that is efficient, scalable, and user-friendly. It integrates frontend and backend technologies with a well-structured database system to ensure smooth operations and secure transactions.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of software engineering principles, including system analysis, system design, database modeling, API development, and testing, resulting in a complete and functional real-world application.

| **Current Situation**   | Customers often face difficulty when searching for suitable furniture online due to scattered platforms, lack of proper categorization, and limited visualization of products. Furniture sellers also struggle to present their products effectively and manage inventory in an organized way. Additionally, administrators lack centralized tools to monitor sales and user activities efficiently. |
| **Issues Identified**   | • Difficulty in finding suitable furniture due to poor search and filtering options.<br>• Lack of detailed product visualization and information.<br>• Sellers have limited tools to manage inventory and showcase products.<br>• No centralized system for tracking orders and sales performance.<br>• Weak user experience in traditional furniture websites.                                      |
| **Impact**              | • Customers may leave without making a purchase due to confusion or lack of clarity.<br>• Sellers lose potential sales Due to the poor product supply..<br>• اA management that cannot make decisions based on clear data.<br>• The overall user experience is poor and uncomfortable..                                                                                                                                        |
| **Need for a Solution** | There is a need for a smart, centralized platform that allows customers to It makes browsing and selecting the right furniture easy, provides sellers with tools to manage their products, and gives management an integrated monitoring and reporting system, while improving the user experience through smart features such as advanced search and clear categorization..                                                                                                                     |
